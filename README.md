## **Overview**

The goal of this project is to:
1. Perform **sentiment analysis** to classify text into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.
2. Use clustering algorithms to group similar texts based on their content and patterns.
3. Visualize and interpret the relationships between text clusters and their sentiment distributions.

This project is ideal for tasks like customer feedback analysis, social media sentiment monitoring, and product review categorization.

## **Features**

- **Text Preprocessing:**  
  - Cleans raw text by removing stopwords, stemming words, and lowercasing.
  - Transforms text into numerical representations using **TF-IDF**.
  
- **Clustering Algorithms:**  
  - Implements **K-Means** for grouping text into \(k\) predefined clusters.
  - Utilizes **DBSCAN** for density-based clustering, identifying outliers and flexible cluster shapes.

- **Sentiment Analysis:**  
  - Uses the **VADER Sentiment Analyzer** to assign polarity scores and classify sentiment.

- **Evaluation and Visualization:**  
  - Evaluates clustering quality using **Silhouette Score**.
  - Visualizes high-dimensional data with **t-SNE** and cluster-specific sentiment distributions.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python** as the core programming language.
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `nltk` for text preprocessing and sentiment analysis.
  - `scikit-learn` for clustering, evaluation, and feature extraction.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for creating visualizations.
